            <summary>Describe what gametes are and explain why they are needed for sexual reproduction. </summary>
            <p>
                Gametes are haploid reproductive cells, like sperm and eggs, that carry half the genetic material from one parent. They are essential for sexual reproduction because their fusion during fertilization creates a zygote with a complete set of chromosomes,
                ensuring genetic diversity and the continuation of the species.

            <summary>Discuss how meiosis contributes to genetic variation, and why genetic variation is important in a population. In your answer, you should: • describe what is meant by genetic variation • explain how the process of meiosis leads to genetic variation
                • explain why genetic variation is of benefit to a population.
            </summary>
            <p>
                Genetic variation means the differences in genes between individuals in a population. These differences make each person (or organism) unique — for example, in eye colour, height, or resistance to disease. Meiosis creates genetic variation in two main
                ways. First, during crossing over in meiosis I, matching chromosomes swap sections of DNA. This mixes up genes from both parents. Second, during independent assortment, chromosomes line up randomly, so each gamete (sex cell) gets a different
                mix of chromosomes. When fertilisation happens, a sperm and egg combine, adding even more variation because every combination is different. Genetic variation is important because it helps a population survive and adapt. If the environment
                changes or a disease spreads, some individuals may have genes that help them survive. These individuals can reproduce and pass on their helpful traits. Without variation, all individuals would be the same and more likely to die out if
                conditions changed. In short, meiosis and fertilisation create genetic variation, and this variation helps populations adapt, evolve, and survive over time.
