            <h3>English</h3>
            <p>
                English is the study, use, and enjoyment of the English language communicated orally, visually, and in writing, for a range of purposes and audiences, and in a variety of forms. It is creative and critical, receptive and productive. In Aotearoa New Zealand,
                the study of English incorporates mātauranga Māori and considers our place in the Pacific.

            <h3>Math</h3>
            <p>
                Mathematics is the exploration and use of patterns and relationships in quantities, space, and time. Statistics is the exploration and use of patterns and relationships in data. These two disciplines are related but involve different ways of thinking
                and solving problems. Both equip ākonga with effective means for modelling, analysing, and interpreting the world in which they live

            <h3>Science</h3>
            <p>
                Science involves generating and testing ideas and gathering evidence to understand, explain, and develop knowledge about the natural world. Scientists do this by making observations, carrying out investigations and modelling, and by communicating and
                debating with others.

                <summary>What are the advantages of online learning?</summary>
                <p>Online learning has helped opened the door to education for people who previously couldn’t attend in-person institutions. Without having to go to a physical campus and with the freedom to watch lectures at any time, students with other
                    commitments, e.g. family or work, can base their studies around their life. At UCEM, you can even decide how many modules you want to take per semester.</p>
