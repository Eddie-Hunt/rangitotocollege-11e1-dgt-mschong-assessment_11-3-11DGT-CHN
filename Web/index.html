            <summary>What are the advantages of online learning?</summary>
            <p>Online learning has helped opened the door to education for people who previously couldnâ€™t attend in-person institutions. Without having to go to a physical campus and with the freedom to watch lectures at any time, students with other commitments, e.g. family or work, can base their studies around their life. At UCEM, you can even decide how many modules you want to take per semester.</p>
