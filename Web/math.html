			<h3>Algebra</h3>
			<p>Algebra is a very prodomenent subject early on in your maths career as it sets up the foundational knowledge that will be built upon in further classes like calculus or physics, unlike any other math type Algebra allows the user to potentially come up with their own unique way of solving problems which allows for very interesting paralells to be drawn.</p>

		<div class="feature-box">
			<h3>Statistics</h3>
			<p>Statistics is the second core alternative version of mathematics which primarily focuses on working out how to calculate probabilitys and work out how much or how little an event is likely to occur, in statistics the user is more exposed to seemingly simpler problems which requires less writing meaning that on exams or tests there is a high probobility that there will be more questions than in algebra how is this important, its important because this is a very fun way to type and i hope that this isnt damaaginig my keyboaaard.</p>
